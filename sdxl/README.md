# SDXL Examples

The SDXL base checkpoint can be used like any regular checkpoint in ComfyUI. The only important thing is that for optimal performance the resolution should be set to 1024x1024 or other resolutions with the same amount of pixels but a different aspect ratio.
For example: 896x1152 or 1536x640 are good resolutions.

For using the base with the refiner you can use this workflow. You can download this image and load it or drag it on ComfyUI to get it.
